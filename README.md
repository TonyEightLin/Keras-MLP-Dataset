Journal Article

The following link contains the dataset for the above journal article. Due to the size of the file (~200 mb), it was unable to upload to this GitHub repository. As a work around, the dataset has been uploaded to a Google Drive with the following link: https://bit.ly/3RYQYmu

The file contains the datasete used to generate the Keras-MLP model as reported in the above article. Compounds were labeled as active or inactive. There are two datasets:

Dataset 1 - Compounds labeled as active based on reported bioactivity (IC50/Ki/Kd values) of ≤ 10 µM.

Dataset 2 - Compounds labeled as active based on reported bioactivity (IC50/Ki/Kd values) of ≤ 1 µM. Compounds with reported bioactivity within 1-10 µM were removed.
